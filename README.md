# Restricted-Array
Assignment: Develop common methods on data structure using a restricted array.
restricted_array.rb provides the RestrictedArray class to be used.
RestrictedArray allows you to:
1. Create an integer array of default size (i.e. chosen randomly from 1-20, inclusive) or of the size provided in the parameter. All integer values are randomly initialized in the range of 1-221. All integer values are randomly initialized in the range of 1 to (200 + size provided), inclusive.
1. Get the value at a given index using `array[index]` format.	Accessing the array at an index less than 0 or greater than its size returns `nil`.
1. Update the value at a given index using `array[index]` format. Attempts to update the array at an index less than 0 or greater than its size are ignored.

None of the other methods available in the Ruby Array class are available in the RestrictedArray class.

### Note

You can use a RestrictedArray instance just like an Array with square brackets []

```ruby
list = RestrictedArray.new(10)
list[3] = 42
```

## Exercise

Implement each of the methods in using_restricted_array.rb.
Above each method, elaborate the comment to explain the time and space complexity.
If you define the time and space complexity in terms of *n*, be sure to explain
what *n* stands for.

Methods to implement are:

- *length* - which calculates the length of the integer array and returns it.
             Note: The restricted_array is terminated by `nil` i.e. `array[length] = nil`
- *print_array* - which prints each integer value separated by space on the same line
- *reverse* - which reverses the values in the array **in place**
  - This means that you **do not** create a 2nd array and copy the elements over in reverse order.
- *search* - which looks for a given integer value in the array. Returns true if found, false otherwise.
             Note: do not assume that the array is sorted.
- *binary_search* - which looks for a given integer value in the array. Returns true if found, false otherwise.
             Note: Assume that the array is sorted in ascending order.
- *find_largest* - Finds and returns the largest value element in the integer array.
- *find_smallest* - Finds and returns the smallest value element in the integer array.

For each method, add a comment above it to explain the time complexity and the space complexity of each method.
